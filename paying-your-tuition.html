<h2><em>Paying your Tuition</em></h2>
<p>Have you recieved your Tuition Bill from Student Accounts and your wondering how to pay your remaining balance? There are a couple ways for you do to this!</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Take out a loan:</b> You can either take out a Parent-PLUS loan, or go with a Private Loan- whichever works best with you and your family.</li>
    <li><b>Do a payment plan at the college:</b> We have a few different payment plan options on a 3 month, 6 month or 9 month payment plan. You can work these details out with the Student Accounts Office</li>
    <li><b>You can do both!</b> Want to take out a loan to pay for part of your tuition, but do a payment plan for the remaining balance? You certainly can do this!</li>
</ol>
