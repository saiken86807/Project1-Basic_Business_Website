## Project Deliverables

Name: Stefanie Aiken

### Overview/description of the project:
A one-stop-shop website for students who have deposited at college and are unsure of what needs to be completed prior to their arrival for move-in weekend at the end of the summer. Many students will come to move-in day and be sent away since they havent completed a number of tasks such as working out payment options for the remainder of their tuition that wasnt covered by scholarships and/or grants they recieved, or not comepleting the HEalth waiver forms so that addditional $2,000 is added onto their tutition bill. by having an Enrollment Portal for students to see "This is what I need to do next" will be helpful in them completing their outstanding tasks, and will also benefit the college with summer melt.
